In this paper we will look at how the pandemic has affected peopleâ€™s mental health sentiment and dietary sentiment using natural language processing. Using a pre-trained BERT model, we can find the sentiment of each free text response and attempt to find correlations with different demographics. With the help of topic modelling, we can find frequency of words to create common topic to see any similarities in responses.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, issues around mental health and well-being gained widespread prominence. Although the lockdown was a short-term strategy to combat the disease, it inevitably gave rise to long-term health issues which may or may not have been aware of before. To understand this, we used a survey done by the Centre for public health at QUB. The response contains demographics of respondents and free text responses regarding their mental health and dietary health. With this dataset we can apply natural language processing methods such as sentimental analysis using BERT and topic modelling to better understand and analyze sentiment of respondents. We can go further and try to find correlation between demography and sentiment to find if different demographics were affected more or less by the pandemic.
